# Restoring buckets and directories from S3

This is a program that can quickly undelete files, folders, or entire buckets en masse from AWS S3 versioned buckets, which comes in handy if you accidentally delete something you wanted to keep. To use this program, your bucket must have [versioning enabled](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/UG/enable-bucket-versioning.html).

## Installing

1. (optional) Make a virtual environment
  * `pip install virtualenvwrapper`
  * `mkvirtualenv s3_utilities`

2. Install python requirements
  * `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Get help

`./s3_undelete.py -h`

## To restore an entire bucket:
`./s3_undelete.py -b some_test_bucket -u`

## To restore a directory within a bucket:
`./s3_undelete.py -b some_test_bucket -f some\ test\ folder -u`

## To restore one object within a directory:
`./s3_undelete.py -b some_test_bucket -k “some/test/file.jpg” -u`

*note: you must have the entire key name (including directories) in order to perform this operation.*

## To delete an object:
`./s3_undelete.py -b some_test_bucket -k “some/test/file.jpg” -d`

*this will prompt the user to confirm before deleting*

## To delete a folder:
`./s3_undelete.py -b some_test_bucket -f some\ test \folder -d`

*this will prompt the user to confirm before deleting each object within a directory*
